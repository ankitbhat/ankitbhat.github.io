# Predicting whether an email is spam or not 
Classify email messages as either spam or not spam The dataset for the project was obtained from apache foundationâ€™s spamassassin public corpus. Exploratory Data Analysis was performed and the problem was approached by using various machine learning models like logistic regression, naive bayes, Random Forest classifier. Advanced modeling technologies like Stacking models and Neural Networks were also used. Logistic regression was chosen as the final model for deployment. The project was deployed on Heroku using Flask.
